usage: .filter [predicate]

The predicate syntax is pretty much similar to that of WHERE clause, without
the support for complex expressions.

For LIKE operator, full JavaScript regular expressions is supported instead
of SQL's syntax.

Examples:

.filter a >= 2 and a <= 10
.filter a between 2 and 10
.filter a LIKE 'a*b'
.filter a IN ('a', 'b', 'c')
.filter a = ANY (1, 2, 3)
