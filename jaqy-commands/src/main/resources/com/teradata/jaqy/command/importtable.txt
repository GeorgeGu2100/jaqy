usage: .importtable [table name]

This command first tries to obtain a schema from the input.  It then
creates a staging table matching the schema of the input.  Lastly, it
imports the data into the staging table.

This command can fail in multiple places.  Failure obtain the input
schema, failure to create the table using the inferred data type, or
failure to import the data for whatever the reason all can happen.
